## Tips and Best Practices

### For Accurate Time Tracking
1. **Complete todos promptly**: Mark tasks as done right after completion while hours are fresh in mind
2. **Be honest with hours**: Enter actual hours spent, not estimated time
3. **Break down large tasks**: Split big tasks into smaller todos for more accurate tracking
4. **Review before submission**: Double-check generated time entries before submitting to Redmine

### For Better AI Matching
1. **Use clear issue keys**: Ensure Backlog issues have proper project prefixes (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
2. **Add milestones**: Include milestone information in Backlog issues for better project matching
3. **Write descriptive titles**: Clear todo titles help AI generate better work descriptions
4. **Add context**: Use todo descriptions for additional context when needed

### For Email Reports
1. **Gmail users**: Generate an App-specific password from Google Account settings
2. **Outlook users**: Use regular password with `smtp-mail.outlook.com` on port 587
3. **Test first**: Always test connection before relying on email reports
4. **Schedule wisely**: Send reports at end of day for daily summaries

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Morning routine**: Sync todos at start of day to see all your tasks
2. **Throughout the day**: Complete todos and track hours as you work
3. **End of day**: Generate and submit time entries to Redmine
4. **Send report**: Email work summary to team or manager
5. **Next day**: Sync again for new issues

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS 13.0 SDK

### Building
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open Glance.xcodeproj

# Or build from command line
xcodebuild -project Glance.xcodeproj -scheme Glance -configuration Release
```

### Testing
- Unit tests: Coming soon
- Integration tests: Coming soon

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All todos and settings stored on your Mac
- **Keychain**: API keys encrypted in macOS Keychain
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry
- **Sandbox**: App runs in macOS sandbox for security

## Troubleshooting

### Backlog Connection Issues
- Verify your Backlog URL format (include `https://`)
- Check API key validity in Backlog settings
- Ensure you have active issues assigned to you
- Use the "Test Connection" button in Settings to verify

### Redmine Connection Issues
- Verify your Redmine URL format (include `https://`)
- Check API key validity in Redmine account settings
- Ensure your account has permissions to:
  - View projects
  - View issues
  - Log time entries
- Use the "Test Connection" button in Settings to verify

### AI Generation Fails
- Verify API key is correct
- Check API endpoint URL (include full URL with protocol)
- Ensure you have API credits/quota remaining
- Try a different model if current one is unavailable
- Use the "Test Connection" button to verify AI service
- Review console logs for specific errors

### Time Entry Generation Issues
- Ensure Redmine is properly configured
- Check that completed todos have valid hours recorded
- Verify that Redmine projects and activities are accessible
- AI matching requires valid Backlog issue keys (e.g., PROJ-123) for best results
- If project matching fails, entries will use default project (非生産)

### Email Sending Fails
- Verify SMTP server and port settings
- For Gmail:
  - Enable 2-factor authentication
  - Generate an App-specific password
  - Use `smtp.gmail.com` port `465` with SSL
- For Outlook:
  - Use `smtp-mail.outlook.com` port `587` with TLS
- Check firewall settings
- Use the "Test Connection" button to verify
- Review error messages for authentication or connection issues
